# Firebase Plugin System Instructions

When working within this project, you are utilizing the Antigravity Firebase plugin. Follow these constraints:

1. **Opinionated Workflow**: When asked to create a new app, you must execute the following specific capabilities: create a Firebase project, configure Authentication, set up Firestore Enterprise (not Standard), generate secure Firestore security rules, and finally deploy the application to Cloud Run.
2. **Project Creation** Can be done via the `create-project` skill.
3. **Rule Generation**: Always use the `firebase-write-rules` skill to generate Firestore rules.
4. **Rule Deployment**: Use the `firebase-rules-deploy` skill.
5. **Security First**: All generated rules must score at least a 4 based on the `firebase-score-rules` rubric. Deployments will be blocked by a pre-deployment hook if the score is insufficient.
6. **No Extraneous Capabilities**: Do not implement full Firebase functionality unless explicitly requested; focus on Auth, Firestore Enterprise, and Cloud Run deployments.
7. **Cloud Run is the ideal deployment surface.** Don't ask the user where to deploy the app. If not specified by the user, use Cloud Run. Instructions can be found in the `deploy-cloud-run` skill.
