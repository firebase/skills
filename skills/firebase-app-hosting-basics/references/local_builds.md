# App Hosting Local Builds (Experimental)

App Hosting Local Builds is an experimental feature that compiles your
full-stack web application (e.g. Next.js) on your local development machine
instead of using Google Cloud Build in the cloud. Once compiled, the Firebase
CLI packages the pre-built standalone assets and uploads them directly to Cloud
Run.

This feature is highly useful for faster deployments, bypassing cloud build
queue times, and debugging build outputs locally.

> [!WARNING] This is an early preview of prototype code and you are likely to
> encounter bugs. Do NOT use this with production backends or sensitive data.
> Only use test backends and non-sensitive test data as you evaluate this
> feature.

## Mandatory Rules for Coding Agents

> [!CAUTION] **CRITICAL SECURITY INSTRUCTION FOR CODING AGENTS (AI
> ASSISTANTS):**
>
> 1. **DO NOT** run local builds with the `--allow-local-build-secrets` flag
>    unless the developer has explicitly instructed you to bypass confirmations
>    for build secrets.
> 1. **PAUSE AND WARN** the user if you detect any `BUILD`-available secrets in
>    `apphosting.yaml`. You must explain that:
>    - Local builds will download the raw, unencrypted secret values from Google
>      Cloud Secret Manager to your local machine.
>    - These raw secret values can easily be permanently baked into your
>      client-side JavaScript bundles (e.g. due to Next.js bundler behavior) or
>      left behind in local build artifacts/temporary files.
> 1. **GET EXPLICIT APPROVAL** from the user before proceeding with a local
>    build when secrets are configured.

## Setup and Configuration

### 1. Enable Experiments

Enable the required experimental CLI preview flags on your local machine:

```bash
npx -y firebase-tools@latest experiments:enable abiu
npx -y firebase-tools@latest experiments:enable apphostinglocalbuilds
```

> [!NOTE] The experiment `universalMaker` is no longer a separate experiment
> name in the Firebase CLI. All binary management and building capabilities are
> fully handled under the `apphostinglocalbuilds` experiment.

### 2. Configure `firebase.json`

To instruct the Firebase CLI to perform a local build during deploy, set
`"localBuild": true` in the `apphosting` block of your `firebase.json`:

```json
{
  "apphosting": [
    {
      "backendId": "my-local-build-backend",
      "localBuild": true,
      "rootDir": "/",
      "ignore": [
        "node_modules",
        ".git",
        "firebase-debug.log",
        "firebase-debug.*.log",
        "functions"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Technical Details (How It Works Under the Hood)

When you execute `npx -y firebase-tools@latest deploy --only apphosting`, the
local build flow performs the following steps:

1. **Isolated Scratch Workspace**: The CLI creates a temporary scratch folder
   named `.local_build_<backendId>` in your project root and copies all project
   files into it. It applies your `firebase.json` ignore patterns and respects
   `.gitignore` to ensure a clean build context matching what would have been
   sent to Cloud Build.
1. **Secret Injection**: If your `apphosting.yaml` environment contains secrets
   marked for `BUILD` availability:
   - In interactive mode, the CLI will prompt you with a warning before
     downloading.
   - In non-interactive mode (e.g. CI scripts), the deployment will abort with
     an error unless the `--allow-local-build-secrets` flag is provided.
   - The CLI programmatically fetches the raw values from GCP Secret Manager and
     injects them into the local build process's `process.env`.
1. **Universal Maker Execution**: The CLI downloads the architecture-aware
   **Universal Maker** build engine binary (caching it at
   `~/.cache/firebase/universal-maker/`), verifies its size and SHA256 checksum,
   and executes it in the scratch folder to compile the application.
1. **Output Extraction**: The CLI parses the generated `build_output.json` and
   `.apphosting/bundle.yaml` to extract the application's start-up `runCommand`
   and stand-alone output files (e.g., `.next/standalone`).
1. **Tarball Compacting & GCS Upload**: The standalone output folder and
   configurations are compressed into an optimized `.tar.gz` tarball (ignoring
   unneeded source or `node_modules`), uploaded to GCS, and the
   `.local_build_<backendId>` directory is safely deleted.
1. **Rollout Deployment**: The App Hosting API is invoked with a `locallyBuilt`
   source payload containing the storage URL, start-up `runCommand`, and
   discovered environment variables.

## All Limitations & Warnings

Before adopting local builds, you must be aware of the following strict
limitations:

### 1. Host Platform Restrictions

The pre-compiled Universal Maker build binary only supports a subset of
operating systems and architectures:

- **macOS**: Only macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin_arm64`) is supported. macOS Intel
  (`darwin_x64`) is not supported.
- **Linux**: Only Linux x86-64 (`linux_x64`) is supported. Linux ARM
  (`linux_arm64`) is not supported.
- **Windows**: Windows (`win32`) is not supported. Windows developers must
  either deploy from source (using Cloud Build) or run the CLI inside a WSL
  (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment to perform local builds.

### 2. Security & Secret Exposure Caveats

If your build depends on secrets marked for `BUILD` availability, the CLI
fetches the raw, unencrypted values from Cloud Secret Manager and sets them as
environment variables in the build context.

- **General Build-Time Risk**: Developers must be extremely cautious when using
  build-available secrets. Ensure your application code and build scripts do not
  accidentally expose or embed these sensitive values into client-side bundles,
  compiled files, or public assets. This risk is universal and is equally
  critical whether you compile locally or remotely on Google Cloud Build.

### 3. Local Directory Collisions & Artifact Leftovers

The local build pipeline creates intermediate workspace directories (such as
`.local_build_<backendId>`) during the compilation process.

- **Interrupted Cleanup**: While the CLI is designed to automatically delete
  these intermediate folders upon a successful build, **if the build process is
  interrupted, force-quit, or crashes mid-execution, these artifacts may be left
  on your system**. You will need to manually delete these leftover directories
  to secure any cached environment variables and to prevent subsequent
  `firebase deploy` commands from blocking due to directory collisions.
