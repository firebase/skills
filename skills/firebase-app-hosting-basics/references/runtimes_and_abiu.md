# App Hosting Runtimes & Automatic Base Image Updates (ABIU)

Firebase App Hosting allows you to choose a specific runtime environment (e.g.,
versioned Node.js) for your backend. When you choose a versioned runtime,
**Automatic Base Image Updates (ABIU)** automatically applies security patches
to your underlying OS/runtime container without requiring you to rebuild or
redeploy.

## Mandatory Rules for Coding Agents

> [!IMPORTANT] **CRITICAL RUNTIME COMPATIBILITY INSTRUCTION FOR CODING AGENTS
> (AI ASSISTANTS):**
>
> 1. **Inspect package.json first**: Before recommending a runtime version or
>    running backend creation commands, you **MUST** read the user's
>    `package.json` file and inspect the `engines.node` field (e.g., if
>    `"engines": { "node": ">=22.0.0" }` is specified, you must select
>    `nodejs22` or `nodejs24`).
> 1. **Prevent mismatch failures**: Creating a backend with a runtime version
>    that is incompatible with the `engines` field will trigger a build failure
>    during the Cloud Build phase.
> 1. **Warn on default runtime**: If the default unversioned `nodejs` runtime is
>    used, warn the developer that ABIU is completely disabled (leaving their
>    container without automated security updates) and recommend migrating to a
>    versioned runtime (e.g. `nodejs22`).

## Specifying Runtime During Backend Creation

When creating a new backend programmatically or in non-interactive environments,
specify the target versioned runtime using the `--runtime` flag:

```bash
npx -y firebase-tools@latest apphosting:backends:create --runtime nodejs22 --backend my-backend-name --primary-region us-central1
```

## Runtime Lifecycles & Support

Runtimes progress through the following lifecycle phases (mirroring Cloud Run's
support):

| Lifecycle State    | Description                                                                                                                                  | Agent Actions                                                                                      |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Supported**      | Fully supported. ABIU security patches are active.                                                                                           | Recommend these versions to users.                                                                 |
| **Deprecated**     | Approaching end of support. Existing apps continue running, but warnings appear in the Console.                                              | Warn the user to migrate to a newer version as soon as possible.                                   |
| **Decommissioned** | Completely unsupported. New builds or backends using this version will fail with errors. Existing containers may stop working or be deleted. | **NEVER** allow creation of new backends on decommissioned versions. Assist the user in upgrading. |
