# 🚀 Supported Migration Strategies

This skill currently supports the **In-Place Migration** strategy.

### 🚜 In-Place Migration (Standard)

The agent modifies the existing V1 code file directly to use V2 syntax and
overwrites the deployment slot.

- **Pros**: Fast, simple, clean repository history.
- **Cons**: No safety net during deployment. If the V2 deployment fails, you
  must rollback using Git.

*Note: For complex or zero-downtime migrations (e.g. Side-by-Side deployment),
refer to external orchestration skills.*

# Prerequisites

Please ensure the workspace is ready for V2 before attempting a code migration:

1. **Configuration Check**: Ensure the workspace has transitioned away from
   functions.config() to Parameterized Configuration or standard environment
   variables.
1. **Dependencies**: The project must be using firebase-functions version that
   supports V2 (>= 4.0.0).

# 🔍 Pre-Migration Checklist

Before modifying any code, the agent should run a quick scan:

1. **Scan for legacy configs**: Run a `grep` or text search for usages of
   `functions.config()`.
   - **Action**: If found, **stop and warn the user** that these configs will
     evaluate to `undefined` in V2 unless they migrate to Parameterized
     Configuration or standard `.env` variables first.

# Principles of Safe Migration

Always follow these principles to ensure zero-touch logic migration:

1. **Use Context-Aware Editing over Global Regex**: Never use naive
   find-and-replace. Rely on syntax-aware editing (such as an AI agent reading
   the file context and making precise edits, or tools like ts-morph/ast
   parsers) to ensure context isolation.
1. **Signature Modernization with Destructuring**: Do NOT rewrite the internal
   variable usages of context or params inside the function body. Instead, use
   JavaScript's native object destructuring in the new V2 signature parameters.
   (Note: For `https.onCall`, the context shim is not available; you should
   destructure `auth` and `data` directly from the request object instead of
   expecting a `.context` property).

### 🛡️ Example Transformation

#### Before (V1 Legacy)

```typescript
import * as functions from "firebase-functions";
export const processOrder = functions.pubsub.topic("orders").onPublish((message, context) => {
  const orderId = message.json.id;
  console.log(`Processing order ${orderId} at ${context.timestamp}`);
});
```

#### After (V2 Target - Safe Migration)

```typescript
import { onMessagePublished } from "firebase-functions/v2/pubsub";
// Using direct object destructuring in the signature!
export const processOrder = onMessagePublished("orders", ({ message, context }) => {
  const orderId = message.json.id; // Legacy logic remains untouched!
  console.log(`Processing order ${orderId} at ${context.timestamp}`);
});
```

# Verification

After making any migration edits, immediately run the following verification
steps:

1. Run `npm run build` to ensure the TypeScript compiler is happy with the types
   and parameters.
1. Run `npm test` to verify no regressions occurred in existing unit tests.

> [!WARNING] **Test Signature Mismatch**: The destructuring shim changes the
> function signature from two arguments `(data, context)` to a single
> destructured object `({ message, context })`.
>
> Existing V1 unit tests that invoke the function with two parameters separately
> (e.g., `myFn(mockData, mockContext)`) **will fail** because the function
> treats `mockData` as the entire event object. You will need to update test
> calls to pass a single object.
>
> **Crucial**: The key name in the test mock must match the specific **Shimmed
> Key** for that trigger (e.g., `change` for `onDocumentWritten`, `snapshot` for
> `onDocumentCreated`, `message` for PubSub, or `object` for Storage).
>
> Example: `myFn({ change: mockChange, context: mockContext })` or
> `myFn({ message: mockMessage, context: mockContext })`. See
> [signature-mapping.md](references/signature-mapping.md) for the exact keys.

# 💸 Performance & Cost Considerations

In Firebase Functions V2, you can handle multiple requests concurrently per
instance (up to 1,000 requests, default 80 if CPU >= 1). However, enabling
concurrency requires assigning at least 1 full CPU.

- **V1 Cost Parity**: If you want to keep V1 fractional CPU pricing (and disable
  concurrency), you must explicitly set `cpu: "gcf_gen1"`.
- **Modernization**: If you want to take advantage of Concurrency, you must
  assign at least 1 CPU.

See [configuration-migration.md](references/configuration-migration.md) for how
to set these options.

# 🛠️ Additional V2 SDK Features

When upgrading to V2, take advantage of modern V2 SDK features where applicable:

- **Declarative Security (IAM Roles & APIs)**: Use `requiresRole("roles/...")`
  and `requiresAPI("service.googleapis.com", "reason")` from
  `firebase-functions/v2` so IAM role and Google Cloud API dependencies are
  declared directly in code instead of instructing users to run manual `gcloud`
  commands.
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Use post-deployment lifecycle hooks (`afterFirstDeploy`,
  `afterRedeploy`) from `firebase-functions/v2` for automated post-deployment
  initialization tasks.
